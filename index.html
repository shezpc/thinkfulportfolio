            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>
               After studying computer science at SFSU for a few years, I felt eager to pick up some front end skills at Thinkful bootcamp and start my work as a web developer. I love the growth that comes with working collaboratively with others to learn new ways of thinking, and am passionate about communication - because of this, I couldn't wait to start my career as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm also a passionate freestyle dancer, and love sharing and competing with others around the world in the dance space.
            </p>
